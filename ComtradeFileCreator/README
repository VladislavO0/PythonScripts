WaveSineGenerator.py allows us to generate the necessary .dat file to obtain waveforms of different signals in different time intervals

Service.py file contains the following functions:
* formation of phase signals by the method of symmetric components;
* generation of instantaneous signal values;
* filling in the cmtrd array for further writing to the csv file

test_generator.py creates an oscillogram with multiple network operation modes
